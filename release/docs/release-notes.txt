Millstone 3.1.0 Release
-----------------------
This version of the Millstone is the first release of the Millstone
Base 3.1 and Millstone WebAdapter 3.1 modules.

The 3.1 version is backward compatible with previous 3.0.x releases.

new adapters and to stabilize the base UI package features.

New features include Form and Field APIs together with new component error
handling framework and application lifecycle frameworks and component
paint mechanism enhancements.

stable distribution of Millstone for production applications and this is
the initial release of that CVS branch.

previous release.
